## Setup

Prior to your interview you should ensure the app is setup correctly. You should be able to see the app error free on `localhost:3000`.

This app was created using Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

1. Ensure you have a modern version of node installed (Exercise tested using v12.6).
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` - this will build and serve the app.
4. Run `yarn test` or `npm run test` - this will run the tests in watch mode.

## Challenges

Relax for now, we'll fill you in on what we'd like you to do during the interview :)
